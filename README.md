# StoreSearch
A way to get data from backend as per user input or filters applied.
Before this I used to send all the available data to the frontend and manipulated accordingly. But if we think of huge chunks front end 
will become slow overtime. So instead of that why not make http requests to get the required data only which will reduce load on the fornt end.

# How to Start<br/>
1. First of all clone the repository. <br/>
2. Go in the terminal and install required node modules using `npm install` or `npm i` <br />
3. Type `npm start` to start the project.<br />
4. Go to `localhost:3000` and try out different routes with your own queries.
